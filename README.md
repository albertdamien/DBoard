# d|board 

This library implements a lightweight scheduler framework for Arduino UNO platform.
It provides an easy to use C++ framework to schedule tasks from polymorphism designed components.
Those batch of components are coming from Grove system, a modular ready-to-use tool set optimized for simplicity and rapid prototyping.

Many examples are alse provided to understand quikly the operation and use of this library.
